# Automated Popular Pre-Launch Experiment (A.P.P.L.E.) v1.1.1

DESCRIPTION

A small mod to eleviate some of the monotonous tasks in KSP:

- auto turn on SAS for vessels that you usually turn it on
- auto setting of lower/left UI to maneuver node mode to see ap/pe info rather than attitude
- auto apply brakes to rovers and planes so stop them rolling away on start
- auto toggle active vessel lights depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto toggle Kerbal helmet lights depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto toggle Kerbal visor (up/down) depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto SAS mode to "Node" when you create a maneauver node
- auto landing gear deployment/retraction at 1000m/100m respectively
- warp lead time changed from 30 secs to 10 secs


NOTES

- Options are configurable to be on/off in the Game Settings menu should you not require certain options
- Vessel lights currently only trigger when vessel is active
- Due to design, when you first create a maneuver node, the navball will spin until you move one of
  the handles and an actual node is created on the navball.


FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

- vessel lights trigger when vessel ISN'T active
