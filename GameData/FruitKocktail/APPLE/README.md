# Automated Popular Pre-Launch Experiment (A.P.P.L.E.)

DESCRIPTION

A small mod to eleviate some of the monotonous tasks in KSP:

- auto turn on SAS for vessels that you usually turn it on
- auto setting of lower/left UI to maneuver node mode to see ap/pe info rather than attitude
- auto apply brakes to rovers and planes so stop them rolling away on start
- auto toggle active vessel lights depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto toggle Kerbal helmet lights depending on whether it is light or dark
- auto toggle Kerbal visor (up/down) depending on whether it is light or dark


NOTES

- options are configurable to be on/off in the Game Settings menu should you not want certain things
- going EVA with a Kerbal who defaults on having helmet removed on Kerbin sometimes affects the visor
  section. No idea why, headlamps work correctly, therefore Unity/game bug
- Vessel lights only trigger when vessel is active


FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

- vessel lights trigger when vessel ISN'T active
- auto SAS mode selection
- auto landing gear deployment
- auto extendibles
- editor filter mode
